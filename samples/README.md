# Samples

This is where we'll put modular tests and samples. That way, we'll have an example of how to implement a certain technique, without digging through the entire codebase!

## Creating Samples

For each sample, please:
* Create a folder housing the sample
* Include an html file and a js file as needed
* Add any necessary files to .gitignore
* If needed, add a build script to the root npm package file to build, run, and server your sample
